# 🎮 Video Game Critic Score Predictor

A machine learning web application that predicts critic scores for video games using Random Forest regression. Built with Streamlit and scikit-learn.

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://your-app-url.streamlit.app)

## 📋 Overview

This project uses a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict video game critic scores based on various features including sales data, user ratings, platform, genre, and publisher information. The model achieves **82.3% accuracy (R² score)** using Random Forest regression.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Dual Prediction Modes
- **Search by Name**: Simply select a game from 5,000+ titles and get instant predictions
- **Manual Entry**: Input custom game details for hypothetical or new games

### 📊 Interactive Dashboard
- **Predict Score**: Get critic score predictions with detailed game information
- **Model Insights**: Understand why Random Forest was chosen and view feature importance
- **Data Explorer**: Explore the dataset with interactive visualizations

### 🎯 Model Performance
- **R² Score**: 0.823 (82.3% variance explained)
- **RMSE**: 5.88 points
- **MAE**: 3.49 points

## 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

### Data Processing
- **Dataset**: 16,719 video games with 8,137 having critic scores
- **Features**: 21 engineered features including:
  - Sales metrics (NA, EU, JP, Other, Global)
  - User and critic review counts
  - Platform, Genre, and Publisher (encoded)
  - Engineered features (sales ratios, game age, review coverage)

### Feature Engineering
- Sales distribution ratios
- User-Critic score difference
- Review count to sales ratio
- Game age calculation
- Categorical encoding

### Model Selection
Tested 5 different models:
- ✅ **Random Forest** (Selected - Best Performance)
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

### Why Random Forest?
- Handles non-linear relationships
- Robust to outliers
- Captures feature interactions
- No feature scaling required
- Provides feature importance insights

## 📊 Key Features Importance

Top factors influencing critic scores:
1. **User_Count** (13.8%) - Number of user reviews
2. **User_Score** (11.5%) - User ratings
3. **NA_Sales** (10.2%) - North American sales
4. **Global_Sales** (9.8%) - Worldwide sales
5. **EU_Sales** (8.9%) - European sales

## 🎨 UI Design

- Clean, minimal interface with blue and green color scheme
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Interactive charts using Plotly
- Real-time predictions with caching for performance
