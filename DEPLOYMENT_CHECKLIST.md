## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: App won't deploy**

**Solutions:**
1. Check if repo is public
2. Verify `requirements.txt` exists
3. Check `app.py` has no syntax errors
4. Ensure `Video_Games_Sales.csv` is in repo

### **Problem: Module not found error**

**Solution:**
Check `requirements.txt` includes all packages:
```
streamlit==1.28.0
pandas==2.0.3
numpy==1.24.3
scikit-learn==1.3.0
plotly==5.17.0
```

### **Problem: CSV file not found**

**Solution:**
- Ensure `Video_Games_Sales.csv` is committed
- Check file path in `app.py` (should be just the filename)
- Verify file is in repository root

### **Problem: App is slow**

**Solutions:**
1. Add `@st.cache_data` to data loading (already done!)
2. Add `@st.cache_resource` to model training (already done!)
3. Check logs for errors

### **Problem: Theme not applied**

**Solution:**
- Ensure `.streamlit/config.toml` exists
- Push changes to GitHub
- Reboot app from dashboard
